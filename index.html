<img src ='imgs/dukey.jpg' alt="Brown, Pug, Jack Russell mix staring at the camera" width="300">
<p>Dukey is a 12 year old Pug, Jack Russell mix and lives with me and my family in Ireland. He is a very small dog, but acts much bigger than his size. He may look like an old man but still has the personality of a new born puppy.</p>
<p>Dukey`s favorite treat are rich tea cookies, as well as anything that falls off of the table at meal time. The rest of the family may call him the family dog, but both him and I know he`s really my dog, and one of my best friends.</p>

  <h1>Ginger</h1>

            <img src="imgs/Ginger.jpg" alt = "Ginger" width = "300">
            <p> Ginger is a 6 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Her favorite activities are swimming in our pool and running around our yard. Occasionally she likes to chase after squirrels and groundhogs that pop up around our yard. She also likes to hog all the dog toys in the house so nobody else can have them. She enjoys antagonizing her younger brother Hank, and you can usually see them rough housing around the house.</p>
            <p>When Ginger is not playing she enjoys sitting in her bed unbothered. She will go onto her bed, and then will turn on her selective hearing. That is when you know that she will side-eye you for anything you are doing.</p>

                <img src="imgs/river.jpg" alt="Fluffy bichon frise wearing santa headband" width="300">
    
                <p>River is a 7 year old bichon frise. Though he is aging, he is extremely active and loves to play. 
                    He likes to throw things. He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if you don’t
                     give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants more. </p>
                     
                <p> River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats. 
                    Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the house 
                    for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held. </p>

        <img src="imgs/labradoodle_leo.JPG" alt="Tan labradoodle " width="300" ">
  
        <p>Leo is a very hyper labradoodle who enjoys running around and meeting new people. Leo recently turned six back
          in July, and received two toys for his birthday which he has already destroyed. Leo also enjoys laying around
          the house, his favorite spots being my parents bedroom and the living room couch.
        <p> Leo is a big fan of when the mailman comes because that means he will get a treat. At bedtime, Leo waits for
          both of my parents to get into bed before he goes to bed. He thinks he needs to guard them while they are both
          still awake.</p>
